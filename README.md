Two servers run simultaneously:
 - API (Python)
 - Frontend server (JS)

Using REST API, I can communicate two different servers to each other irrespective of language used.

requirements.txt is mentioned
and
npm i can be run to install the node dependencies

nodemon start server.js ---> Runs Frontend server (JS)
flask --app server.js run ---> Runs API server (Python)


How python code works?
 - Using scikit I trained the model on the basis of 'Crop_recommendation.csv'
 - You can follow 'commands.txt'
